## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I want like to have more focus on using grid. Also, specifically for this project, I was unable to figure out how I would change the curved background images to the mobile versions when using responsive design. I placed my images in the HTML so I was unsure how I would change them when viewed for mobile screens. To work around this I used position: relative and adjusted the position based on the screen size.

### Useful resources

- [Freecodecamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvUrASNj0s&t=11834s) - I already have experience using responsive design but this tutorial really helped understand units and which ones work best and when.
- [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ohtVzCSHqs&t=751s) - I attempted this challenge with desktop first in mind which left my webpage in a complete mess when trying to make it responsive. This tutorial really made me understand why building out HTML & CSS with mobile first approach makes it so much easier.
